Shades on my eyes
Cover my tears
You see the smile
I feel the fear, so
Paint my lips red
Throw on some heels
Hold up my head
And tonight, I'll remind myself that
I'm the 1, 2, and 3
Kissing the mirror, I'm she
Struck like lightning, so ignited
You can hate me for me
Baby, that's your loss
Don't love me for somebody I'm not
I'm burning HOT
There's a fire living inside me
And it won't burn out after dark
So tonight, I'm not gonna fight it
Bonnie and Clyde it, oh
Not running from it
Not running from it
Who I'm becoming
I love it
Like it or not
I'm burning HOT
Matches
Gonna strike one, light one up on my baggage
Imagine
All the beautiful things that used to be ashes
Practice
Getting off the bench to work on myself
When it hurts like hell
I know that I'm
I'm the 1, 2, and 3
Kissing the mirror, I'm she
Struck like lightning, so ignited
You can hate me for me
Baby, that's your loss
Don't love me for somebody I'm not
I'm burning HOT
There's a fire living inside me
And it won't burn out after dark
So tonight, I'm not gonna fight it
Bonnie and Clyde it, oh
Not running from it
Not running from it
Who I'm becoming
I love it
Like it or not
I'm burning HOT
I'm burning HOT
