I'm burning hot
Shades on my eyes cover my tears
You see the smile, I feel the fear so
Paint my lips red, throw on some heels
Hold up my head and tonight, I'll remind myself that
I'm the one, two, and three, kissing the mirror, I'm she
Struck like lightning, so ignited
You can hate me for me, baby, that's your loss
Don't love me for somebody I'm not
I'm burning hot (hot)
There's a fire living inside me
And it won't burn out after dark (dark)
So tonight, I'm not gonna fight it
Bonnie and Clyde it, oh
Not running from it, not running from it
Who I'm becoming, I love it
Like it or not (hot)
I'm burning hot (I'm burning hot)
Matches, lightin' up all of my baggage
Oh, you were so savage (oh)
But now I'm glowing by myself
Bet it hurts like hell, I know that I'm
Now I'm strong, you did me wrong, kept stringing me along
I should've seen the signs, wasted all my time, yeah (yeah)
Now I'm on top, and you're not, baby, that's your loss (loss)
Don't love me for somebody I'm not
I'm burning hot (hot)
There's a fire living inside me
And it won't burn out after dark (dark)
So tonight, I'm not gonna fight it (gonna fight it)
Bonnie and Clyde it (Bonnie and Clyde it, oh) oh
Not running from it, not running from it (oh-oh-oh)
Who I'm becoming, I love it
Like it or not (like it or not)
I'm burning hot (I'm burning hot, oh)
Oh-oh, oh, oh-yeah, oh-yeah
