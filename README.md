[00:04.42] I'm burning hot
[00:11.92] 
[00:06.93] Shades on my eyes, cover my tears
[00:10.54] You see the smile, I feel the fear so
[00:14.53] Paint my lips red, throw on some heels
[00:18.19] Hold up my head, and tonight I'll remind myself that
[00:44.19] 
[00:22.79] I'm the one, two, and three, kissing the mirror, I'm she
[00:26.69] Struck like lightning, so ignited
[00:30.56] You can hate me for me, baby, that's your loss
[00:33.46] Don't love me for somebody I'm not
[00:50.46] 
[00:36.44] I'm burning hot (hot), there's a fire living inside me
[00:42.44] And it won't burn out after dark (dark)
[00:46.24] So tonight, I'm not gonna fight it, Bonnie and Clyde it, oh
[00:52.72] Not running from it, not running from it
[00:56.57] Who I'm becoming, I love it
[00:58.98] Like it or not (hot), I'm burning hot (I'm burning hot)
[01:26.48] 
[01:07.80] Matches, lighting up all of my baggage
[01:12.84] Oh, you were so savage (oh)
[01:15.60] But now I'm glowing by myself, bet it hurts like hell (I know that I'm)
[01:51.10] 
[01:22.87] Now I'm strong, you did me wrong, kept stringing me along
[01:26.56] I should've seen the signs, wasted all my time, yeah (yeah)
[01:30.47] Now I'm on top, and you're not, baby, that's your loss
[01:33.77] Don't love me for somebody I'm not
[01:50.77] 
[01:36.53] I'm burning hot (hot), there's a fire living inside me
[01:42.60] And it won't burn out after dark (after dark, dark)
[01:46.33] So tonight, I'm not gonna fight it (gonna fight it)
[01:49.71] Bonnie and Clyde it, oh (Bonnie and Clyde it, oh)
[01:52.82] Not running from it, not running from it (oh-oh)
[01:56.73] Who I'm becoming, I love it (I love it)
[01:59.04] Like it or not (hot, like it or not), I'm burning hot (I'm burning hot)
[02:34.54] 
[02:07.44] Ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, oh yeah
[02:20.11] Whoa-oh, yeah
